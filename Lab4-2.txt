Overview: 
The player can roll around to its heart’s content… but it has no purpose. 
In this lab, we fill that purpose by creating an enemy to challenge the player! 
First we will give the enemy a texture of your choice, 
then give it the ability to bounce the player away... potentially knocking them off the cliff. 
Lastly, we will let the enemy chase the player around the island and spawn in random positions.

Project Outcome:
A textured and spherical enemy will spawn on the island at start, in a random location determined by a custom function. 
It will chase the player around the island, bouncing them off the edge if they get too close. 

New Functionality:
Enemy spawns at random location on the island
Enemy follows the player around 
Spheres bounce off of each other

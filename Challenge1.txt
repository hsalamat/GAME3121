Challenge Overview: 
Use the skills you learned in the driving simulation to fly a plane around obstacles in the sky. 
You will have to get the user’s input from the up and down arrows 
in order to control the plane’s pitch up and down. 
You will also have to make the camera follow alongside the plane so you can keep it in view. 

Challenge Outcome:
The plane moves forward at a constant rate
The up/down arrows tilt the nose of the plane up and down
The camera follows along beside the plane as it flies

Note: When you import the challenge into your project, 
it is supposed to have bugs. 
The purpose of the challenge is for you to fix those bugs:

1. The plane is going backward, Make the plane go forward
2. The plane is going too fast, Slow the plane down to a manageable speed
3. The plane is tilting automatically, Make the plane tilt only if the user presses the up/down arrows
4. The camera is in front of the plane, Reposition it so it’s beside the plane
5. The camera is not following the plane, Make the camera follow the plane
6. The plane’s propeller does not spin, Create a script that spins the plane’s propeller

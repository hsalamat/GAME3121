Overview: 
First things first, we will create a new prototype and download the starter files! 
Youâ€™ll notice a beautiful island, sky, and particle effect... all of which can be customized! 
Next you will allow the player to rotate the camera around the island in a perfect radius, 
providing a glorious view of the scene. The player will be represented by a sphere, 
wrapped in a detailed texture of your choice. Finally you will add force to the player, 
allowing them to move forwards or backwards in the direction of the camera.

Project Outcome:
The camera will evenly rotate around a focal point in the center of the island, 
provided a horizontal input from the player. The player will control a textured sphere, 
and move them forwards or backwards in the direction of the aforementioned focal point.

New Functionality:
Camera rotates around the island based on horizontal input
Player rolls in direction of camera based on vertical input

New Concepts and Skills:
Texture Wraps
Camera as child object
Global vs Local coordinates
Get direction of other object

Overview: 
This game is looking extremely good, but it’s missing something critical: Sound effects and Particle effects! 
Sounds and music will breathe life into an otherwise silent game world, and particles will make the player’s actions more dynamic and eye-popping. 
In this lesson, we will add cool sounds and particles when the character is running, jumping, and crashing.

Project Outcome:
Music will play as the player runs through the scene, kicking up dirt particles in a spray behind their feet. 
A springy sound will play as they jump and a boom will play as they crash, bursting in a cloud of smoke particles as they fall over.

New Functionality:
Music plays during the game
Particle effects at the player’s feet when they run
Sound effects and explosion when the player hits an obstacle

New Concepts and Skills:
Particle systems 
Child object positioning
Audio clips and Audio sources 
Play and stop sound effects

//In computer science, resource contention is a conflict over access to a shared resource such as random access memory, 
//  disk storage, cache memory, internal buses or external network devices. ... Resource contention results when multiple processes attempt to use the same shared resource
//In computer programming, a mutual exclusion object(mutex) is a program object that allows multiple program threads 
// to share the same resource, such as file access, 
//but not simultaneously.When a program is started, a mutex is created with a unique name

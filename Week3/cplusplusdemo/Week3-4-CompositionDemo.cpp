//  complex objects are often built from smaller, simpler objects. 
//Object Composition: A personal computer is built from a CPU, a motherboard, some memory
//Many games and simulations have creatures or objects that move around a board, map, or screen. 
//One thing that all of these creatures/objects have in common is that they all have a location. 
//In this example, we are going to create a creature class that uses a point class to hold the creature’s location.

//Because aggregations are similar to compositions in that they are both part - whole relationships, 
// they are implemented almost identically, and the difference between them is mostly semantic.
//In a composition, we typically add our parts to the composition using normal member variables
// (or pointers where the allocation and deallocation process is handled by the composition class).
//In an aggregation, we also add parts as member variables. 
// However, these member variables are typically either references or pointers 
// that are used to point at objects that have been created outside the scope of the class.
//Consequently, an aggregation usually either takes the objects it is going to point to as constructor parameters, 
//or it begins empty and the subobjects are added later via access functions or operators.

//Technically speaking, the “has - a” relationship is called composition,
//while the “uses - a” relationship is called aggregation

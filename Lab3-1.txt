Overview: 
The goal of this lab is to set up the basic gameplay for this prototype. 
We will start by creating a new project and importing the starter files. 
Next we will choose a beautiful background and a character for the player to control, 
and allow that character to jump with a tap of the spacebar. 
We will also choose an obstacle for the player, 
and create a spawn manager that throws them in the player’s path at timed intervals. 

Project Outcome:
The character, background, and obstacle of your choice will be set up. 
The player will be able to press spacebar and make the character jump, 
as obstacles spawn at the edge of the screen and block the player’s path.

New Functionality:
Player jumps on spacebar press
Player cannot double-jump
Obstacles and Background move left
Obstacles spawn on intervals

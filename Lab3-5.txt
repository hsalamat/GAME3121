Overview: 
In this lab, you program the player’s basic movement, including the code that limits that movement. 
In order to do this, you will need to do research, reference other code, and problem-solve when things go wrong.

Project Outcome:
The player will be able to move around based on user input, but not be able to move where they shouldn’t. 

New progress:
Player can move based on user input
Player movement is constrained to suit the requirements of the game

New concepts & skills: 
Program in C# independently
Troubleshoot issues independently

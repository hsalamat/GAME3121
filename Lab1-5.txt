Overview: 
In this first ever Lab session, you will begin the preliminary work required 
to successfully create a personal project in this course. 
First, youâ€™ll learn what a personal project is, what the goals for it are, 
and what the potential limitations are. 
Then you will take the time to come up with an idea and outline it in detail in your Design Document, 
including a timeline for when you hope to complete certain features. 
Finally, you will take some time to draw a sketch of your project 
to help you visualize it and share your idea with others.

Project Outcome:
The Design Document will be filled out, including the concept, the timeline, 
and a preliminary sketch of the minimum viable product.

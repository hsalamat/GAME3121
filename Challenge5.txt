Challenge Overview: 
Put your User Interface skills to the test with this whack-a-mole-like challenge in which 
you have to get all the food that pops up on a grid while avoiding the skulls.  

You will have to debug buttons, mouse clicks, score tracking, restart sequences, 
and difficulty setting to get to the bottom of this one. 

Challenge Outcome:
All of the buttons look nice with their text properly aligned
When you select a difficulty, the spawn rate changes accordingly
When you click a food, it is destroyed and the score is updated in the top-left
When you lose the game, a restart button appears that lets you play again

Note: When you import the challenge into your project, it is supposed to have bugs. 
The purpose of the challenge is for you to fix those bugs, which are listed below. 

1. The difficulty buttons look messy: Center the text on the buttons horizontally and vertically
2. The food is being destroyed too soon: The food should only be destroyed when the player clicks on it, 
   not when the mouse touches it
3. The Score is being replaced by the word “score”: It should always say, 
   “Score: __“ with the value displayed after “Score:”
4. When you lose, there’s no way to Restart: Make the Restart button appear on the game over screen
5. The difficulty buttons don’t change the difficulty: The spawnRate is always way too fast. 
   When you click Easy, the spawnRate should be slower - if you click Hard, the spawnRate should be faster.
6. The game can go on forever: Add a “Time: __” display that counts down from 60 in whole numbers (i.e. 59, 58, 57, etc) 
   and triggers the game over sequence when it reaches 0.

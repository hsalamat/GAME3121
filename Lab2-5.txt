Overview: 
You will create and set up the project that will soon transform into your very own Personal Project. 
For now, you will use “primitive” shapes (such as spheres, cubes, and planes) as placeholders 
for your objects so that you can add functionality as efficiently as possible without getting bogged down by graphics. 
To make it clear which object is which, you will also give each object a unique colored material. 

Project Outcome:
All key objects are in the scene as primitive objects with the camera positioned properly for your project type.

New progress:
New project for your Personal Project
Camera positioned and rotated based on project type
All key objects in scene with unique materials

New concepts & skills:

Overview: 
We added a great score counter to the game, but there are plenty of other game-changing UI elements that we could add. 
In this lab, we will create some “Game Over” text that displays when a “good” target object drops below the sensor. 
During game over, targets will cease to spawn and the score will be reset. 
Lastly, we will add a “Restart Game” button that allows the player to restart the game after they have lost.

Project Outcome:
When a “good” target drops below the sensor at the bottom of the screen, 
the targets will stop spawning and a “Game Over” message will display across the screen. 
Just underneath the “Game Over” message will be a “Reset Game” button that reboots the game and resets the score, 
so the player can enjoy it all over again.

New Functionality:
A functional Game Over screen with a Restart button
When the Restart button is clicked, the game resets

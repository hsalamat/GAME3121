Overview: 
In this lab you will make your driving simulator come alive. 
First you will write your very first lines of code in C#, 
changing the vehicleâ€™s position and allowing it to move forward. 
Next you will add physics components to your objects, 
allowing them to collide with one another. 
Lastly, you will learn how to duplicate objects in the hierarchy 
and position them along the road. 

Project Outcome:
You will have a moving vehicle with its own C# script and a road full of objects, 
all of which may collide with each other using physics components.

New Functionality:
Vehicle moves down the road at a constant speed
When the vehicle collides with obstacles, they fly into the air

Overview: 
In this lab, you will finally replace those boring primitive objects with beautiful dynamic ones. 
You will either use assets from the provided course library or browse the asset store for completely new ones 
to give your game exactly the look and feel that you want. 
Then, you will go through the process of actually swapping in those new assets in the place of your placeholder primitives. 
By the end of this lab, your project will be looking a lot better.

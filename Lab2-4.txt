Overview: 
Our game is coming along nicely, but there are some critical things we must add before it’s finished. 
First off, instead of pressing S to spawn the animals, we will spawn them on a timer so that they appear every few seconds. 
Next we will add colliders to all of our prefabs and make it so launching a projectile into an animal will destroy it. 
Finally, we will display a “Game Over” message if any animals make it past the player.

Project Outcome:
The animals will spawn on a timed interval and walk down the screen, triggering a “Game Over” message if they make it past the player. 
If the player hits them with a projectile to feed them, they will be destroyed.

New Functionality:
Animals spawn on a timed interval and walk down the screen. 
When animals get past the player, it triggers a “Game Over” message.
If a projectile collides with an animal, both objects are removed.

New Concepts & Skills:
Create custom methods/functions
InvokeRepeating() to repeat code
Colliders and Triggers 
Override functions

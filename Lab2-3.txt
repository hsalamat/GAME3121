Overview: 
Our animal prefabs walk across the screen and get destroyed out of bounds, 
but they donâ€™t actually appear in the game unless we drag them in! 
In this lesson we will allow the animals to spawn on their own, in a random location at the top of the screen. 
In order to do so, we will create a new object and a new script to manage the entire spawning process. 

Project Outcome:
When the user presses the S key, a randomly selected animal will spawn at a random position at the top of the screen, 
walking towards the player.

New Functionality:
The player can press the S to spawn an animal
Animal selection and spawn location are randomized
Camera projection (perspective/orthographic) selected

New Concepts & Skills:
Spawn Manager
Arrays
Keycodes
Random generation
Local vs Global variables
Perspective vs Isometric projections

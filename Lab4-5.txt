Overview: 
In this lab, you will work with all of your non-player objects in order 
to bring your project to life with its basic gameplay. 
You will give your projectiles, pickups, or enemies their basic movement 
and collision detection, make them into prefabs, 
and have them spawned randomly by a spawn manager. 
By the end of this lab, you should have a glimpse into the core functionality of your game.

Project Outcome:
Non-player objects are spawned at appropriate locations in the scene with basic movement. 
When objects collide with each other, they react as intended, by either bouncing 
or being destroyed.

Overview: 
To finish our game, we will add a Menu and Title Screen of sorts. 
You will create your own title, and style the text to make it look nice. 
You will create three new buttons that set the difficulty of the game. 
The higher the difficulty, the faster the targets spawn!

Project Outcome:
Starting the game will open to a beautiful menu, with the title displayed prominently 
and three difficulty buttons resting at the bottom of the screen. 
Each difficulty will affect the spawn rate of the targets, increasing the skill required to stop “good” targets from falling.

New Functionality:
Title screen that lets the user start the game
Difficulty selection that affects spawn rate

New Concepts and Skills:
AddListener() 
Passing parameters between scripts
Divide/Assign (/=) operator
Grouping child objects

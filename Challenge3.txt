Challenge Overview: 
Apply your knowledge of physics, scrolling backgrounds, 
and special effects to a balloon floating through town, 
picking up tokens while avoiding explosives. 
You will have to do a lot of troubleshooting in this project because it is riddled with errors. 

Challenge Outcome:
The balloon floats upwards as the player holds spacebar
The background seamlessly repeats, simulating the balloon’s movement
Bombs and Money tokens are spawned randomly on a timer 
When you collide with the Money, there’s a particle and sound effect
When you collide with the Bomb, there’s an explosion and the background stops 

Note: When you import the challenge into your project, 
it is supposed to have bugs. 
The purpose of the challenge is for you to fix those bugs:

1. The player can’t control the balloon, The balloon should float up as the player presses spacebar
2. The background only moves when the game is over, The background should move at start, then stop when the game is over
3. No objects are being spawned, Make bombs or money objects spawn every few seconds
4. Fireworks appear to the side of the balloon, Make the fireworks display at the balloon’s position
5. The background is not repeating properly, Make the background repeat seamlessly
6. The balloon can float way too high, Prevent the player from floating their balloon too high
7. The balloon can drop below the ground, Make the balloon appear to bounce off of the ground, 
preventing it from leaving the bottom of the screen. There should be a sound effect when this happens, too!

Overview: 
Objects fly into the scene and the player can click to destroy them, but nothing happens. 
In this lab, we will display a score in the user interface that tracks and displays the player’s points. 
We will give each target object a different point value, adding or subtracting points on click. 
Lastly, we will add cool explosions when each target is destroyed. 

Project Outcome:
A “Score: “ section will display in the UI, starting at zero. When the player clicks a target, 
the score will update and particles will explode as the target is destroyed. 
Each “Good” target adds a different point value to the score, while the “Bad” target subtracts from the score.

New Functionality:
There is a UI element for score on the screen
The player’s score is tracked and displayed by the score text when hit a target
There are particle explosions when the player gets an object

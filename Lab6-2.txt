Overview: 
In this lab, you will learn about a variety of different techniques to optimize your projects and make them more performant.
You may not notice a huge difference in these small prototype projects, but when youâ€™re exporting a larger project, 
especially one for mobile or web, every bit of performance improvement is critical. 

Project Outcome:
Several of your prototype projects will have improved optimization, 
serving as examples for you to implement in your personal projects

New Concepts and Skills
Optimization
Object Pooling

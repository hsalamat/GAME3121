Overview: 
In this lab, you will attempt to add a speedometer and RPM display for your vehicle. 
In doing so, you will learn the process of doing online research when trying to implement new features 
and troubleshoot bugs in your projects. As you will find out, adding a new feature is very rarely 
as simple as it initially seems - you inevitably run into unexpected complications 
and errors that usually require a little online research. In this lab, you will learn how to do that 
so that you can do it with your own projects.

Project Outcome:
By the end of this lab, the vehicle will behave with more realistic physics,  
and there will be a speedometer and Revolution per Minute (RPM) display.

New Concepts and Skills:
Searching on Unity Answers, Forum, Scripting API
Troubleshooting to resolve bugs
AddRelativeForce, Center of Mass, RoundToInt
Modulus/Remainder (%) operator
Looping through lists
Custom methods with bool return

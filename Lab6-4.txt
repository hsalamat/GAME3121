Overview: 
In this lab, you will learn how to build your projects so that theyâ€™re playable 
outside of the Unity interface. First, you will install the necessary export modules 
to be able to publish your projects. After that, you will build your project as a standalone app 
to be played on Mac or PC computers. Finally, you will export your project for WebGL 
and even upload it to a game sharing site so that you can send it to your friends and family.

Project Outcome:
Your project will be exported and playable as a standalone app on Mac/PC or for embedding online.

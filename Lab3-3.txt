Overview: 
The game is looking great so far, but the player character is a bit… lifeless. 
Instead of the character simply sliding across the ground, we’re going to give it animations for running, 
jumping, and even death! We will also tweak the speed of these animations, 
timing them so they look perfect in the game environment.

Project Outcome:
With the animations from the animator controller, the character will have 3 new animations 
that occur in 3 different game states. These states include running, jumping, and death, 
all of which transition smoothly and are timed to suit the game.

New Functionality:
The player starts the scene with a fast-paced running animation.
When the player jumps, there is a jumping animation.
When the player crashes, the player falls over.

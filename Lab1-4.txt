Overview: 
In this lab, we need to hit the road and gain control of the vehicle. In order to do so, we need to detect 
when the player is pressing the arrow keys, then accelerate and turn the vehicle based on that input. 
Using new methods, Vectors, and variables, you will allow the vehicle to move forwards or backwards and turn left to right.

Project Outcome:
When the player presses the up/down arrows, the vehicle will move forward and backward. 
When the player presses the left/right arrows, the vehicle will turn.

New Functionality:
When the player presses the up/down arrows, the vehicle will move forward and backward
When the player presses the left/right arrows, the vehicle turns

Overview:
The enemy chases the player around the island, but the player needs a better way to defend themselves... 
especially if we add more enemies. In this lab, weâ€™re going to create a powerup that gives the player 
a temporary strength boost, shoving away enemies that come into contact! 
The powerup will spawn in a random position on the island, and highlight the player with an indicator when it is picked up. 
The powerup indicator and the powerup itself will be represented by stylish game assets of your choice.

Project Outcome:
A powerup will spawn in a random position on the map, eagerly awaiting the player. 
Once the player collides with this powerup, the powerup will disappear and the player will be highlighted by an indicator. 
The powerup will last for 5 seconds after pickup, granting the player super strength that blasts away enemies!

New Functionality:
When the player collects a powerup, a visual indicator appears
When the player collides with an enemy while they have the powerup, the enemy goes flying
After a certain amount of time, the powerup ability and indicator disappear
